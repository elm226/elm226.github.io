		<p>I'm Ellen, a marketing and new business specialist with a knack for writing and a passion for changing the world. I'm currently on the Technical Marketing Track at Startup Institute, where I learn to do awesome things like build this mini-website. My background involves using media, technology, and storytelling to create social change and bolster social movements. A (very) amateur screenwriter and enthusiastic event planner, I just moved to Boston from New York and can't wait for my next adventure.</p>
